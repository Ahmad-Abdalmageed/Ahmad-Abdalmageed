### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Ahmad Abdalmageed :blush: , I am a Senior Biomedical Engineer at Cairo University. I found passion in programming and has been working my way through the field ever since. Python was my first step into the world of Programming then i found about the great wonders of Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence :sparkles:. I made a great progress in that field taking courses like Andrew Ng`s Specialization and doing personal projects on my own :smirk:. I am a self-taught Programmer, I am proud of that :muscle:. I am now looking to improve my knowledge in the field of AI and make more interesting projects :raised_hands:.
